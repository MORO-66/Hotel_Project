Hello, this is Bing. I can help you with creating all the functions needed for the project file based on Java. ðŸ˜Š

Here is the list of functions that I think are necessary for each module:

- User Module
  - addEmployee: This function takes the data of a new employee (id, name, email, password, role) and adds it to the array of employees.
  - updateEmployee: This function takes the id of an existing employee and the new data (name, email, password, role) and updates the corresponding employee in the array of employees.
  - deleteEmployee: This function takes the id of an existing employee and removes it from the array of employees.
  - displayEmployees: This function displays the details of all the employees in the array of employees.
  - addCustomer: This function takes the data of a new customer (id, name, email, password, loyaltyPoints) and adds it to the array of customers.
  - updateCustomer: This function takes the id of an existing customer and the new data (name, email, password, loyaltyPoints) and updates the corresponding customer in the array of customers.
  - deleteCustomer: This function takes the id of an existing customer and removes it from the array of customers.
  - displayCustomers: This function displays the details of all the customers in the array of customers.
  - addRoom: This function takes the data of a new room (number, type, service, status) and adds it to the array of rooms.

  - deleteRoom: This function takes the number of an existing room and removes it from the array of rooms.
  - displayRooms: This function displays the details of all the rooms in the array of rooms.

- Room Management Module
  - enterGuestDate: This function takes the id of a customer and the date of check-in and check-out and assigns a room to the customer based on the availability and preference of the customer.
  - filterRooms: This function takes one or more criteria (status, type, service) and returns a list of rooms that match the criteria.
